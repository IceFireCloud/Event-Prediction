Quick touch-up to the code.

The "master" script is crime_start.py, which I realize now is a rather
unfortunate name.

Before this, activate Jacob's tensorflow environment:
source /home/jharer/env/tensorflow_1.3/bin/activate

Then you should be good to go. The structure of the code is much that same as
that of the the standard EP.
