Gavin Brown's To-Do list

- Merge saving stuff back to new_frame/general
    - Make spearmint_subfolder? IDK
- Figure out how to encode layers in Spearmint
- Add parameters to Spearmint search, shrink space of searched parameters
    - Note to increase possible epochs
    - Can we include datapoints from previous runs?
- Automate setting up spearmint experiment?
- Ask Jacob about resetting the CPU clock to wall time, can't be difficult


Stuff to merge back:
base_model.py
    x settings contains 'label_as_signal', as does base_model.data_processing()
    x Add self.save_settings()
CNN.py
    x Need to add "return(model)" in self.run_model()
spearmint_start.py
    - getting information from command line, putting it in settings
    - Taking out function around running an experiment
    - Use values of experiment.mean[median]_MSE_ratio
Experiment.py
    x Add self.get_new_index()
    x Add lines in self.run_experiment() that get indices
    x Add data gathering and recording to self.record_save()
    x Assign output of model.run_model()
    x Figure out where we are talking about self.keras_model
init_tables.py
    - mv, done
call_spearmint_start.py
    - mv, done
config.json
    - mv, done
