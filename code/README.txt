Code for working with LA crime data.
"replication" contains code to replicate "Deep Learning for Real Time
Forecasting," by Wang, Bertozzi, et al.

Our current code sits in LA_crime/our_models/1D_CNN.
    The folder is a mix of old and new code.
    You need to activate Xiao's environment:
        "source /home/xzhou/tensorflow/bin/activate"
    and specify a GPU.
    After that, the code to run sits in "crime_start.py",
        which is Python3 code.
I think that code should be either inscrutable data processing or 
    straightforward modelling.

There's other code in these directories, either small analysis scripts
    or data wrangling.
