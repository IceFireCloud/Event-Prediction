# [Mixed Spatio-Temporal Neural Networks on Real-time Prediction of Crimes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9679984)

This is the place for code base of the publised paper above.

Conference: ICMLA (2021)

Due to the long-term development (2017~2021) and multiple changes of leadership, we have several different environments for the developed networks and models, which range from a platform with relatively old version (i.e. tensorflow on @ ~2017) to a more up-to-current framework (i.e. pytorch version @ ~2021). Therefore, please assume different environments for different models, and check the code before actually run it.

For now, we directly provide the original source files for use. In the future, this repo will be updated and reformed to provide a more user-friendly entrance.

### Prerequisites

```
Envorinment: Linux, with GPU available
Programming Language: python3
Framework: pytorch, tensorflow
```
